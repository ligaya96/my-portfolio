In this weeks homework, We were asked make our very first mobile responsive Portilio page using Bootstrap CSS Framework. I wanted to make this portilio as professional and personal as I can, so i did use personal pictures and information. I do hope to keep adding more to my portiflio as I grow as a Coder. I worked on the semenatics, and as well as adding a Navbar from Bootstrap. I do feel like my containters, rows, and columns can be worked on, but i tried my best on using the grid systems to the best of my abilities. I was able to get all my html pages layout mobile responsive, as well as my pictures.
